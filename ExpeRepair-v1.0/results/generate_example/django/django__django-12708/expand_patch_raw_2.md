 Looking at the candidate patch and the analysis provided, I can see that the issue is with how Django handles the deletion of index_together when the same fields also have a unique_together constraint. The candidate patch attempts to solve this by post-filtering constraint names, but this approach is overly complex and has several issues.

Let me analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Root Cause**: When `_delete_composed_index` is called to delete an index on fields that also have a unique constraint, `_constraint_names` returns both the regular index and the unique constraint (which also acts as an index). This causes the method to find 2 constraints instead of the expected 1.

2. **Issues with Candidate Patch**: 
   - Makes multiple calls to `_constraint_names` which is inefficient
   - Adds complex filtering logic deep in the helper method
   - Handles both index and unique cases even though only the index case is problematic
   - Could affect other database backends like MySQL

3. **Better Solution**: The analysis suggests a much simpler approach - be more specific about what type of constraint we want by passing both `index` and `unique` flags to clearly distinguish between them.

Following the suggestion to modify the calling code rather than the helper method, here's my refined patch:

# modification 1
```
<file>django/db/backends/base/schema.py</file>
<original>        # Deleted uniques
        for fields in olds.difference(news):
            self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True}, self.sql_delete_unique)</original>
<patched>        # Deleted uniques
        for fields in olds.difference(news):
            self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True, 'index': False}, self.sql_delete_unique)</patched>
```

# modification 2
```
<file>django/db/backends/base/schema.py</file>
<original>        # Deleted indexes
        for fields in olds.difference(news):
            self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)</original>
<patched>        # Deleted indexes
        for fields in olds.difference(news):
            self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True, 'unique': False}, self.sql_delete_index)</patched>
```

**Reasoning for this approach:**

1. **Simplicity**: This solution is much simpler than the candidate patch. Instead of adding complex post-filtering logic, we simply make the constraint selection more precise from the start.

2. **Clarity**: By explicitly specifying both `index` and `unique` flags, we make it clear what type of constraint we're looking for:
   - When deleting index_together: we want `index=True, unique=False` (only non-unique indexes)
   - When deleting unique_together: we want `unique=True, index=False` (only unique constraints)

3. **Efficiency**: This avoids the multiple calls to `_constraint_names` that the candidate patch introduced.

4. **Targeted Fix**: We only modify the calling code, leaving the `_delete_composed_index` method unchanged. This reduces the risk of affecting other parts of the system or database-specific overrides.

5. **Symmetrical**: Both unique and index deletion paths are handled consistently, making the code more maintainable.

6. **Preserves Existing Logic**: The existing error handling and validation in `_delete_composed_index` remains intact, so if there are still multiple matches after this more specific filtering, the appropriate error will still be raised.

This approach directly addresses the root cause by ensuring that `_constraint_names` only returns the specific type of constraint we want to delete, eliminating the ambiguity that caused the original issue.
