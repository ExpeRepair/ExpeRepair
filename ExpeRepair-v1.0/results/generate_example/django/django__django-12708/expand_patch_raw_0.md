 Looking at the issue and the candidate patch, I need to understand the root problem and propose a better solution.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue occurs when both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, and then `index_together` is removed. The `_delete_composed_index` method finds both the unique constraint and the index constraint, causing it to fail with "Found wrong number (2) of constraints".

## Issues with the Candidate Patch

The candidate patch has several problems:
1. **Backwards logic**: It filters out the constraint type we actually want to delete
2. **Inefficient**: Makes multiple calls to `_constraint_names`
3. **Complex**: The filtering logic is convoluted and hard to follow
4. **Risky**: Could end up with no constraints to delete after filtering

## My Refined Approach

The key insight is that we need to be more precise about which constraint we want to delete based on the operation context. When `alter_index_together` calls `_delete_composed_index`, it should only delete index constraints, not unique constraints, even if they're on the same fields.

The solution is to modify the constraint selection logic to be more specific about constraint types when multiple constraints exist on the same fields.

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Identify the constraint type we want**: Use the `constraint_kwargs` to determine if we're looking for unique or index constraints
2. **Handle the multiple constraints case**: When we find multiple constraints, filter to get only the type we actually want to delete
3. **Use clearer logic**: Instead of complex filtering, use direct constraint type queries
4. **Maintain error handling**: Keep the original error handling for truly ambiguous cases

Here's my refined patch:

```
<file>django/db/backends/base/schema.py</file>
<original>    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):
        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}
        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}
        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]
        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
            **constraint_kwargs
        )
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))</original>
<patched>    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):
        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}
        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}
        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]
        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
            **constraint_kwargs
        )
        
        # Handle the case where both unique and index constraints exist on the same fields
        if len(constraint_names) > 1:
            # If we're specifically looking for unique constraints, exclude index-only constraints
            if constraint_kwargs.get('unique', False) and not constraint_kwargs.get('index', False):
                index_constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
                    model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
                    index=True, unique=False
                )
                constraint_names = [name for name in constraint_names if name not in index_constraint_names]
            # If we're specifically looking for index constraints, exclude unique-only constraints
            elif constraint_kwargs.get('index', False) and not constraint_kwargs.get('unique', False):
                unique_constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
                    model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
                    unique=True, index=False
                )
                constraint_names = [name for name in constraint_names if name not in unique_constraint_names]
        
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))</patched>
```

## Key Improvements Over the Candidate Patch

1. **Correct Logic**: The patch now correctly identifies and keeps the constraint type we want to delete, rather than filtering it out
2. **More Precise**: Uses explicit checks for `unique=False` and `index=False` to get constraints of only the desired type
3. **Clearer Intent**: The code clearly shows we're excluding the opposite constraint type from what we want to delete
4. **Safer**: Only applies the filtering logic when we have multiple constraints and are looking for a specific type
5. **Better Comments**: Explains exactly what we're doing and why

This solution addresses the core issue: when both unique and index constraints exist on the same fields, we need to be more specific about which one to delete based on the operation being performed (removing `unique_together` vs `index_together`).
