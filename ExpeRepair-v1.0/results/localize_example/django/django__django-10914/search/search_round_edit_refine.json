In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker."

        "content": " <analysis>\nLet me analyze this issue step by step:\n\n1. **Issue Understanding**: The problem is that Django's file upload mechanism can result in inconsistent file permissions depending on whether a `MemoryUploadedFile` or `TemporaryUploadedFile` is used. When `TemporaryUploadedFile` is used (for larger files), the temporary file created by Python's `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` has restrictive permissions (0o600), and when this file is moved to its final location, it retains these restrictive permissions instead of having more standard permissions like 0o644.\n\n2. **Root Cause Analysis**: \n   - The issue occurs in the `FileSystemStorage._save()` method where there are two different code paths:\n     - Path 1: When `content` has a `temporary_file_path()` (TemporaryUploadedFile), it uses `file_move_safe()` to move the file\n     - Path 2: When it's a normal uploaded file (MemoryUploadedFile), it creates a new file with `os.open()` using 0o666 permissions\n   - The problem is that `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is currently set to `None` by default, so when a temporary file is moved, it keeps its original restrictive permissions (0o600) instead of being changed to more appropriate permissions.\n\n3. **Code Analysis**:\n   - In `django/conf/global_settings.py`, line 307 shows `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None`\n   - In `django/core/files/storage.py`, the `FileSystemStorage` class handles file permissions:\n     - The `file_permissions_mode` property (lines 216-217) gets its value from `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n     - In the `_save()` method (lines 283-284), permissions are only set if `self.file_permissions_mode is not None`\n   - The issue suggests changing the default from `None` to `0o644`\n\n4. **Locations to Modify**:\n   - The primary location is the global settings file where `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is defined\n   - The FileSystemStorage class and its `_save()` method need to be reviewed to understand how permissions are applied\n   - The `file_permissions_mode` property needs to be examined to understand how it processes the setting\n</analysis>\n\n<file>\n  <path>django/conf/global_settings.py</path>\n  <location>\n    <class></class>\n    <method></method>\n    <start_line>305</start_line>\n    <end_line>308</end_line>\n  </location>\n</file>\n\n<file>\n  <path>django/core/files/storage.py</path>\n  <location>\n    <class>FileSystemStorage</class>\n    <method>__init__</method>\n    <start_line>178</start_line>\n    <end_line>184</end_line>\n  </location>\n  <location>\n    <class>FileSystemStorage</class>\n    <method>file_permissions_mode</method>\n    <start_line>215</start_line>\n    <end_line>218</end_line>\n  </location>\n  <location>\n    <class>FileSystemStorage</class>\n    <method>_save</method>\n    <start_line>251</start_line>\n    <end_line>287</end_line>\n  </location>\n</file>"
