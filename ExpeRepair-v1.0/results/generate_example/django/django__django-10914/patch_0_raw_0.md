 ### Phase 1: FIX ANALYSIS

1. **Problem Statement:**
The issue is that uploaded files can have inconsistent permissions depending on how they are uploaded. When files are uploaded as `TemporaryUploadedFile` (large files that use temporary files), they inherit restrictive permissions (0o600) from Python's `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`. However, when files are uploaded as `MemoryUploadedFile` (small files kept in memory), they get the default file creation permissions (typically 0o664). This inconsistency occurs because `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` defaults to `None`, so no explicit permission setting is applied.

2. **Test Script Analysis:**
The test script demonstrates the issue by showing:
- Regular files get 0o664 permissions by default
- Temporary files created by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` get restrictive 0o600 permissions
- When `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not set, temporary uploaded files preserve their restrictive 0o600 permissions after being moved to the final location
- When `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is explicitly set to 0o644, all uploaded files get consistent 0o644 permissions
- Small files uploaded via `SimpleUploadedFile` get normal 0o664 permissions since they don't use temporary files

3. **Code Analysis:**
Looking at the provided code locations:
- Location #1: `django/conf/global_settings.py` shows `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` (line 307)
- Location #3: `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode` returns the setting value or None
- Location #4: `FileSystemStorage._save` method only applies `os.chmod()` when `self.file_permissions_mode is not None` (lines 283-284)

The problem occurs because when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None`, no permission correction is applied after file upload, so temporary files keep their restrictive 0o600 permissions.

4. **Best Practices:**
- Files should have consistent, reasonable permissions regardless of upload method
- Default permissions should be secure but not overly restrictive for typical web applications
- 0o644 (readable by owner and group, writable by owner only) is a common, reasonable default for uploaded files
- The fix should maintain backward compatibility

5. **Fix Strategy:**
Change the default value of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` from `None` to `0o644` in `django/conf/global_settings.py`. This ensures that all uploaded files get consistent, reasonable permissions regardless of whether they go through the temporary file path or the direct write path.
