 Looking at this issue, I need to understand the problem and implement a fix.

## Phase 1: FIX ANALYSIS

### 1. Problem Statement
The issue is about inconsistent file permissions when uploading files to Django's FileSystemStorage. When `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not explicitly set (defaults to None), files uploaded via `TemporaryUploadedFile` (large files that go through temporary storage) end up with restrictive permissions (0o600) inherited from the temporary file, while files uploaded via `SimpleUploadedFile` (small files handled in memory) get the system's default file creation permissions (typically 0o664).

### 2. Test Script Analysis
The test script demonstrates the issue clearly:
- **Test 2** shows that temporary files created by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` have restrictive permissions (0o600)
- **Test 3** shows that when using the temporary file path approach (simulating `TemporaryUploadedFile`), the final file gets permissions 0o664 (not preserving the temp file's 0o600, which seems to contradict the issue description, but the inconsistency is the real problem)
- **Test 4** shows that when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS=0o644` is explicitly set, the permissions are correctly applied
- **Test 5** shows that `SimpleUploadedFile` gets default permissions (0o664)

The inconsistency occurs because different upload methods result in different permission handling.

### 3. Code Analysis
Looking at the provided code locations:

- **Location #1**: `django/conf/global_settings.py` line 307 shows `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None`
- **Location #3**: `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode` returns the setting value or None
- **Location #4**: In `_save()` method, `os.chmod()` is only called when `self.file_permissions_mode is not None` (line 283-284)

The problem is that when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is None (default), no explicit permission setting occurs, leading to inconsistent behavior between different upload methods.

### 4. Best Practices
- Default permissions should be reasonable and secure
- 0o644 (readable by owner and group, writable by owner only) is a common, secure default for uploaded files
- The behavior should be consistent regardless of upload method
- Changes should be backward compatible

### 5. Fix Strategy
The fix should change the default value of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` from `None` to `0o644`. This ensures:
- Consistent permissions across all upload methods
- Reasonable security (readable by others, writable only by owner)
- Explicit permission setting for all uploaded files

## Phase 2: FIX IMPLEMENTATION

# modification 1
```
<file>django/conf/global_settings.py</file>
<original># The numeric mode to set newly-uploaded files to. The value should be a mode
# you'd pass directly to os.chmod; see https://docs.python.org/library/os.html#files-and-directories.
FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None</original>
<patched># The numeric mode to set newly-uploaded files to. The value should be a mode
# you'd pass directly to os.chmod; see https://docs.python.org/library/os.html#files-and-directories.
FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644</patched>
```

This single change resolves the issue by:

1. **Ensuring consistency**: All uploaded files will now have their permissions explicitly set to 0o644, regardless of whether they went through temporary file storage or in-memory handling.

2. **Providing reasonable security**: 0o644 allows the file owner to read and write, while others can only read. This is a standard, secure permission setting for uploaded files.

3. **Maintaining backward compatibility**: Existing code that explicitly sets `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` will continue to work as before. Only the default behavior changes.

4. **Fixing the root cause**: Instead of just documenting the inconsistency, this actually resolves it by ensuring all uploaded files get consistent permissions.

The fix is minimal and targeted - it only changes the default value in the global settings, which will flow through to the `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode` property and ensure that `os.chmod()` is always called with a consistent permission value.
