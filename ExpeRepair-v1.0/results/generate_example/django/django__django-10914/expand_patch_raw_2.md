 After carefully reviewing the analysis and suggestions, I'll propose a refined patch that addresses the core issue while considering backward compatibility and consistency.

## Reasoning

1. **Core Issue**: The problem is inconsistent file permissions between small files (MemoryUploadedFile) and large files (TemporaryUploadedFile). Large files get restrictive 0o600 permissions due to tempfile behavior, while small files inherit system umask.

2. **Analysis of Approaches**: The suggestions present two main approaches:
   - Approach 1: Change global default (candidate patch)
   - Approach 2: Handle defaults in FileSystemStorage only

3. **Decision**: I'm choosing to stick with the candidate patch approach (changing the global default) for these reasons:
   - It's simpler and more explicit
   - The backward compatibility concern is minimal since projects can override the setting if needed
   - It provides consistent behavior across all Django installations
   - The analysis confirms this is the most straightforward solution

4. **Improvements**: Based on the suggestions, I'll also set a default for directory permissions to maintain consistency, and update the comment to reflect the new default.

Here's my refined patch:

# modification 1
```
<file>django/conf/global_settings.py</file>
<original># The numeric mode to set newly-uploaded files to. The value should be a mode
# you'd pass directly to os.chmod; see https://docs.python.org/library/os.html#files-and-directories.
FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None

# The numeric mode to assign to newly-created directories, when uploading files.
# The value should be a mode as you'd pass to os.chmod;
# see https://docs.python.org/library/os.html#files-and-directories.
FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS = None</original>
<patched># The numeric mode to set newly-uploaded files to. The value should be a mode
# you'd pass directly to os.chmod; see https://docs.python.org/library/os.html#files-and-directories.
# Defaults to 0o644 (readable by owner, group, and others; writable by owner only).
FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644

# The numeric mode to assign to newly-created directories, when uploading files.
# The value should be a mode as you'd pass to os.chmod;
# see https://docs.python.org/library/os.html#files-and-directories.
# Defaults to 0o755 (readable and executable by all; writable by owner only).
FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS = 0o755</patched>
```

## Explanation of Changes

1. **FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS**: Changed from `None` to `0o644` as in the candidate patch. This ensures consistent permissions across all upload paths and resolves the core inconsistency issue.

2. **FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS**: Changed from `None` to `0o755` to provide consistent directory permissions. This addresses the suggestion about ensuring newly created upload directories have sensible permissions.

3. **Updated Comments**: Added explanatory comments for both settings to document the new defaults and their meaning, making the behavior explicit for developers.

This refined patch:
- Resolves the core inconsistency issue by providing explicit defaults
- Ensures both file and directory permissions are consistently set
- Maintains the simplicity of the original candidate patch
- Provides clear documentation of the new behavior through updated comments
- Allows projects to override these defaults if different behavior is desired

The defaults chosen (0o644 for files, 0o755 for directories) are standard, secure defaults that balance accessibility with security - files are readable by all but only writable by the owner, and directories are readable and traversable by all but only writable by the owner.
