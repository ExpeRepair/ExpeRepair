 Looking at the issue description, I need to understand the core problem:

1. **Issue**: Migration crashes when deleting an `index_together` if there's a `unique_together` on the same fields
2. **Root cause**: The `_delete_composed_index()` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` finds multiple constraints (both unique and index) and fails with "Found wrong number (2) of constraints"
3. **Steps to reproduce**: 
   - Create a model with 2 fields
   - Add the same fields to both `unique_together` and `index_together`
   - Try to delete `index_together` → Should fail

From the existing test file, I can see the testing patterns:
- Use `OperationTestBase` for migration operation tests
- Create operations using `migrations.AlterIndexTogether` and `migrations.AlterUniqueTogether`
- Use `apply_operations` method to test migration forward/backward
- Test both state changes and database changes

Let me create a minimal test script that reproduces this issue:

```python
