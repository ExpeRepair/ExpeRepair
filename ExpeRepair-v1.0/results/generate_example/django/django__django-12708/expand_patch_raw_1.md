 Looking at the analysis and suggestions, I need to address the fundamental issues with the candidate patch:

1. **The candidate patch is overly complex** - it handles both index and unique deletion paths when only the index path has the problem
2. **It makes redundant calls** to `_constraint_names` 
3. **It adds unnecessary symmetric logic** for unique constraint deletion that's never hit in practice
4. **It risks affecting other callers** like MySQL's override

The core issue is that when dropping an `index_together` constraint, if there's also a `unique_together` on the same fields, the database introspection finds both the regular index AND the unique constraint (which also appears as an index), causing the "Found wrong number of constraints" error.

After reviewing both proposals in the suggestions, I believe **Proposal A** is the better approach because:

1. **It's simpler and more direct** - prevents the problem from occurring rather than trying to fix it after the fact
2. **It's more efficient** - no additional database introspection calls needed
3. **It's safer** - doesn't touch the low-level `_delete_composed_index` method that other backends override
4. **It's more logical** - if a unique constraint exists on the same fields, there's no separate index to drop anyway

Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. **Root cause identification**: The issue occurs when trying to drop an index_together constraint on fields that also have a unique_together constraint, because the database sees both constraints as "indexes"

2. **Solution approach**: Instead of trying to disambiguate at the low level, prevent the attempt to drop an index when a unique constraint already covers those fields

3. **Implementation**: In `alter_index_together`, check if the fields being removed from index_together are still covered by unique_together, and skip the deletion if so

4. **Benefits**: This approach is clean, efficient, and doesn't affect other code paths or backend-specific overrides
