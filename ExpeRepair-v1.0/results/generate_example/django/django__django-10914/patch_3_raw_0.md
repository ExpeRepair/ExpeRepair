 ## Phase 1: FIX ANALYSIS

### 1. Problem Description
The issue is about inconsistent file permissions when uploading files to Django's FileSystemStorage. When no explicit `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting is configured, the final permissions of uploaded files depend on whether the upload used a `MemoryUploadedFile` (small files) or `TemporaryUploadedFile` (large files). 

For `TemporaryUploadedFile`, Django uses Python's `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()` which creates files with restrictive `0o600` permissions for security reasons. When Django moves these temporary files using `os.rename()` or similar operations, the restrictive permissions are preserved, resulting in files that may not be readable by the web server or other processes that need access.

### 2. Test Script Analysis
The test script demonstrates the issue clearly:

- **Test 1**: Shows regular file creation has `0o664` permissions (readable by group/others)
- **Test 2**: Shows `NamedTemporaryFile` creates files with `0o600` permissions (restrictive)  
- **Test 3**: Simulates Django's behavior without `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` - the temp file has `0o600` but the final file gets `0o664`, showing that in this test environment the permissions are actually being corrected
- **Test 4**: Shows that with explicit `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS=0o644`, the final file correctly gets `0o644` permissions
- **Test 5**: Shows `SimpleUploadedFile` (in-memory) gets `0o664` permissions

The key insight is that without an explicit `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting, the behavior is inconsistent and system-dependent.

### 3. Code Analysis
Looking at the provided code locations:

- **Location #1** (`django/conf/global_settings.py`): `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` - This is the default setting
- **Location #3** (`django/core/files/storage.py`): The `file_permissions_mode` property returns the setting value or None
- **Location #4** (`django/core/files/storage.py`): In the `_save` method, `os.chmod()` is only called if `self.file_permissions_mode is not None` (line 283-284)

The problem occurs because when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None` (default), Django doesn't explicitly set file permissions after saving, leaving it up to the system's default behavior which can be inconsistent.

### 4. Best Practices
- Provide consistent, predictable behavior regardless of upload size or method
- Use secure but reasonable default permissions (0o644 is standard for web-accessible files)
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow the principle of least surprise

### 5. Solution
The fix should change the default value of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` from `None` to `0o644`. This ensures that all uploaded files get consistent, reasonable permissions regardless of whether they went through temporary file storage or not.

## Phase 2: FIX IMPLEMENTATION

The fix requires only one modification - changing the default value of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` in Django's global settings.

# modification 1
```
<file>django/conf/global_settings.py</file>
<original># The numeric mode to set newly-uploaded files to. The value should be a mode
# you'd pass directly to os.chmod; see https://docs.python.org/library/os.html#files-and-directories.
FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None</original>
<patched># The numeric mode to set newly-uploaded files to. The value should be a mode
# you'd pass directly to os.chmod; see https://docs.python.org/library/os.html#files-and-directories.
FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644</patched>
```

This single change resolves the issue by:

1. **Ensuring consistency**: All uploaded files will now have `0o644` permissions by default, regardless of upload method
2. **Providing reasonable defaults**: `0o644` (readable by owner/group/others, writable by owner) is a standard permission for web-accessible files
3. **Maintaining backward compatibility**: Users who have explicitly set `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` will see no change in behavior
4. **Following security best practices**: The permissions are secure but not overly restrictive for typical web applications

The fix is minimal and targeted, addressing exactly the issue described without affecting other functionality.
