        "content": "<issue>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n</issue>"

Write the patch using the strict format specified below:\n- Each modification must be enclosed in:\n  - `<file>...</file>`: replace `...` with actual file path.\n  - `<original>...</original>`: replace `...` with the original code snippet from the provided code locations.\n  - `<patched>...</patched>`: replace `...` with the fixed version of the original code.\n- The `<original>` block must contain an exact, continuous block of code from the provided code locations, as the system relies on this for locating modifications.\n- When adding original code and patched code, pay attention to indentation, as the code is in Python.\n- DO NOT include line numbers in the patch.\n- You can write up to three modifications if needed.\n\nEXAMPLE PATCH FORMAT:\n# modification 1\n```\n<file>...</file>\n<original>...</original>\n<patched>...</patched>\n```\n\n# modification 2\n```\n<file>...</file>\n<original>...</original>\n<patched>...</patched>\n```\n\n# modification 3\n```\n...\n```\n"

When files are uploaded as `TemporaryUploadedFile` (large files that use temporary files), they inherit restrictive permissions (0o600) from Python's `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`. However, when files are uploaded as `MemoryUploadedFile` (small files kept in memory), they get the default file creation permissions (typically 0o664). This inconsistency occurs because `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` defaults to `None`, so no explicit permission setting is applied.\n\n2. **Test Script Analysis:**\nThe test script demonstrates the issue by showing:\n- Regular files get 0o664 permissions by default\n- Temporary files created by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` get restrictive 0o600 permissions\n- When `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not set, temporary uploaded files preserve their restrictive 0o600 permissions after being moved to the final location\n- When `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is explicitly set to 0o644, all uploaded files get consistent 0o644 permissions\n- Small files uploaded via `SimpleUploadedFile` get normal 0o664 permissions since they don't use temporary files\n\n3. **Code Analysis:**\nLooking at the provided code locations:\n- Location #1: `django/conf/global_settings.py` shows `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` (line 307)\n- Location #3: `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode` returns the setting value or None\n- Location #4: `FileSystemStorage._save` method only applies `os.chmod()` when `self.file_permissions_mode is not None` (lines 283-284)\n\nThe problem occurs because when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None`, no permission correction is applied after file upload, so temporary files keep their restrictive 0o600 permissions.\n\n4. **Best Practices:**\n- Files should have consistent, reasonable permissions regardless of upload method\n- Default permissions should be secure but not overly restrictive for typical web applications\n- 0o644 (readable by owner and group, writable by owner only) is a common, reasonable default for uploaded files\n- The fix should maintain backward compatibility\n\n5. **Fix Strategy:**\nChange the default value of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` from `None` to `0o644` in `django/conf/global_settings.py`. This ensures that all uploaded files get consistent, reasonable permissions regardless of whether they go through the temporary file path or the direct write path.\n\n### Phase 2: FIX IMPLEMENTATION\n\n# modification 1\n```\n<file>django/conf/global_settings.py</file>\n<original># The numeric mode to set newly-uploaded files to.

Code Analysis\nLooking at the provided code locations:\n\n- **Location #1**: `django/conf/global_settings.py` line 307 shows `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None`\n- **Location #3**: `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode` returns the setting value or None\n- **Location #4**: In `_save()` method, `os.chmod()` is only called when `self.file_permissions_mode is not None` (line 283-284)\n\nThe problem is that when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is None (default), no explicit permission setting occurs, leading to inconsistent behavior between different upload methods.\n\n### 4. Best Practices\n- Default permissions should be reasonable and secure\n- 0o644 (readable by owner and group, writable by owner only) is a common, secure default for uploaded files\n- The behavior should be consistent regardless of upload method\n- Changes should be backward compatible\n\n### 5. Fix Strategy\nThe fix should change the default value of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` from `None` to `0o644`.

This is a standard, secure permission setting for uploaded files.\n\n3. **Maintaining backward compatibility**: Existing code that explicitly sets `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` will continue to work as before. Only the default behavior changes.\n\n4. **Fixing the root cause**: Instead of just documenting the inconsistency, this actually resolves it by ensuring all uploaded files get consistent permissions.\n\nThe fix is minimal and targeted - it only changes the default value in the global settings, which will flow through to the `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode` property and ensure that `os.chmod()` is always called with a consistent permission value."

When no explicit `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting is configured, the final permissions of uploaded files depend on whether the upload used a `MemoryUploadedFile` (small files) or `TemporaryUploadedFile` (large files). \n\nFor `TemporaryUploadedFile`, Django uses Python's `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()` which creates files with restrictive `0o600` permissions for security reasons.
