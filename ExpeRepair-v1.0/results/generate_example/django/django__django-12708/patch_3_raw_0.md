 ### Phase 1: FIX ANALYSIS

**Problem Statement:**
The issue occurs when trying to delete an `index_together` constraint from a Django model that has both `unique_together` and `index_together` defined on the same fields. The migration crashes with a `ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints` because the `_delete_composed_index` method finds both the unique constraint and the index constraint, but expects to find exactly one constraint.

**Code Analysis:**
The problem occurs in the `_delete_composed_index` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at lines 410-415. When this method is called from `alter_index_together` to delete an index, it uses `_constraint_names` to find constraints matching the given columns and constraint type. However, when both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, the method finds both constraints but expects exactly one, causing the ValueError.

The issue is that:
1. `alter_index_together` calls `_delete_composed_index` with `{'index': True}` to find index constraints
2. `_constraint_names` method (not shown in the code context) apparently returns both unique and index constraints when looking for index constraints on the same columns
3. The validation `if len(constraint_names) != 1:` fails because it finds 2 constraints instead of 1

**Best Practices:**
1. The method should be more specific about which constraint type to delete
2. When deleting an index constraint, it should not interfere with unique constraints on the same fields
3. The constraint identification should be more precise to avoid ambiguity

**Solution:**
The fix should modify the `_delete_composed_index` method to be more specific about constraint selection. When deleting an index constraint, it should exclude unique constraints from consideration, and vice versa. This can be achieved by modifying the constraint selection logic to be more precise about the constraint type being targeted.

### Phase 2: FIX IMPLEMENTATION

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `_delete_composed_index` method where it doesn't properly distinguish between different types of constraints when the same fields have both unique and index constraints.
