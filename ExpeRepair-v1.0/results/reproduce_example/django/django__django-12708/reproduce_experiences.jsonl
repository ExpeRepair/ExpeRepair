After setting up the model, explicitly inspect that the index exists (e.g. via `connection.introspection.get_constraints`) before running `AlterIndexTogether`.  \n4. In the test for deleting index_together, catch the specific ValueError from `_delete_composed_index` rather than the OperationalError.  \n5.

After correcting the literal, re-run and ensure each test function prints its \u201c### Test N:\u201d header and input/output as intended.\n3. Consider simplifying to only the minimal reproduction (Test 1 or Test 3) so you don\u2019t rely on Django introspection details that may vary by version.\n4. Wrap the constraint-detection logic in Test 2 in a safe try/except, and verify that `get_constraints` is called with the correct signature for your Django version.\n5. Finally, validate that each test block is executed sequentially by guarding execution under `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` and that no syntax or import errors remain."}}]}
