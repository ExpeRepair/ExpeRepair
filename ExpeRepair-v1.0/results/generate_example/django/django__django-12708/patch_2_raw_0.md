 ### Phase 1: FIX ANALYSIS

**Problem Description:**
The issue occurs when trying to delete an `index_together` constraint from a Django model that also has a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields. The migration crashes with a `ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints` because the `_delete_composed_index` method finds both the unique constraint and the index constraint, but expects to find exactly one constraint.

**Code Analysis:**
The problem occurs in the `_delete_composed_index` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at lines 410-415. When this method is called from `alter_index_together` (line 396), it searches for constraints matching the given fields and constraint type. However, when both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, the `_constraint_names` method returns multiple constraints, causing the validation to fail.

The issue is that:
1. `alter_index_together` calls `_delete_composed_index` with `{'index': True}` to find index constraints
2. `_constraint_names` may return both unique and index constraints when they exist on the same fields
3. The method expects exactly one constraint but finds multiple, causing the ValueError

**Best Practices:**
1. The method should be more specific about which type of constraint it's looking for
2. When deleting an index constraint, it should only target actual index constraints, not unique constraints
3. The fix should be minimal and not break existing functionality
4. The method should handle the case where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields

**Fix Strategy:**
The fix should modify the `_delete_composed_index` method to be more precise about constraint selection. When looking for index constraints to delete, it should exclude unique constraints from consideration, since a unique constraint serves a different purpose than a regular index constraint.
