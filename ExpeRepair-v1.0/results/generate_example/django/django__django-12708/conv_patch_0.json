        "content": " ### Phase 1: FIX ANALYSIS\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nThe issue occurs when trying to delete an `index_together` constraint from a Django model that also has a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields. The migration crashes with a `ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints` because the `_delete_composed_index` method finds both the unique constraint and the index constraint, but expects to find exactly one constraint.\n\n**Code Analysis:**\nThe problem occurs in the `_delete_composed_index` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at lines 410-415. When this method is called from `alter_index_together` to delete an index, it searches for constraints matching the given fields and constraint type. However, when both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, the `_constraint_names` method returns both constraints, causing the length check to fail.\n\nThe key issue is that the current implementation assumes there will be exactly one constraint matching the criteria, but when both unique and index constraints exist on the same fields, multiple constraints are found.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n1. The fix should be minimal and targeted to the specific problem\n2. Should maintain backward compatibility\n3. Should handle the case where multiple constraints exist gracefully\n4. Should not break existing functionality for cases where only one constraint exists\n\n**Solution:**\nThe fix should modify the `_delete_composed_index` method to be more specific about which constraint to delete. When deleting an index constraint, it should specifically look for index constraints and ignore unique constraints on the same fields. This can be achieved by making the constraint search more specific by using the constraint type information that's already being passed to the method.\n\n### Phase 2: FIX IMPLEMENTATION\n\nThe fix involves modifying the `_delete_composed_index` method to filter the constraint names more specifically based on the constraint type being deleted.\n\n```\n<file>django/db/backends/base/schema.py</file>\n<original>    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n            **constraint_kwargs\n        )\n        if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n            raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n                len(constraint_names),\n                model._meta.db_table,\n                \", \".join(columns),\n            ))\n        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))</original>\n<patched>    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n            **constraint_kwargs\n        )\n        if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n            #
