Looking at the execution results and analyzing the issue, I can see the problems with my original script:

1. **Test 2 failed** due to SQLite syntax errors when trying to use raw SQL - I need to use Django's database introspection APIs instead
2. **Test 3 didn't properly remove index_together** - I used `AlterModelOptions` incorrectly instead of `AlterIndexTogether`
3. **The core issue wasn't reproduced** - I need to trigger the actual `_delete_composed_index()` method that contains the bug

From the issue description, the bug occurs in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at line 378 in `_delete_composed_index()` when it finds multiple constraints (both unique and index) for the same fields and throws a `ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints`.

Looking at the existing test patterns in the provided test file, I should:
- Use proper migration operations like `AlterIndexTogether` and `AlterUniqueTogether`
- Use the `apply_operations` pattern correctly
- Focus on triggering the database schema operations where the bug occurs
- Avoid low-level database introspection that varies by backend

Here's my corrected approach:

**Reasoning for the corrections:**

1. **Fixed Test 2**: Used `AlterIndexTogether` with an empty list `[]` instead of trying to manipulate raw SQL, which properly triggers Django's schema operation path where the bug occurs.

2. **Fixed Test 3**: Used `AlterIndexTogether` with `None` to properly remove index_together constraints, and used a separate app label to avoid state conflicts.

3. **Fixed Test 4**: Used Django's `connection.introspection.get_constraints()` API instead of raw PRAGMA SQL, which is database-agnostic and avoids SQLite-specific syntax issues.

4. **Better state management**: Used global variable to preserve state between tests and separate app labels to avoid conflicts.

5. **Focused on the core issue**: The updated script specifically targets the `_delete_composed_index()` method behavior by creating scenarios where multiple constraints exist on the same fields and then trying to remove one type.

The script should now properly reproduce the ValueError mentioned in the issue: "Found wrong number (2) of constraints" that occurs when Django's schema backend tries to delete an index_together constraint but finds both the index and unique constraints on the same fields.
