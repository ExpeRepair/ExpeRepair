{"time": "2025-06-23 22:29:41", "issue_description": "Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.", "exps": [{"old_patch": "", "old_result": false, "new_patch": "diff --git a/django/conf/global_settings.py b/django/conf/global_settings.py\nindex acee9887d2..bdeec80610 100644\n--- a/django/conf/global_settings.py\n+++ b/django/conf/global_settings.py\n@@ -304,7 +304,7 @@ FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR = None\n \n # The numeric mode to set newly-uploaded files to.
