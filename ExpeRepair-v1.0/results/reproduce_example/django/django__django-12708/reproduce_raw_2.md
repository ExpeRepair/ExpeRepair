## Analysis and Reasoning

Looking at the execution issues were:

1. **SQL quoting problems**: The table names were being incorrectly quoted in SQL, causing "no **State management issues**: The `apply_operations` helper wasn't properly managing the progression of states between operations
3. **Incorrect introspection approach**: Using Django's introspection API incorrectly for SQLite

Based on the suggestions and the example corrections provided, I need to:

1. **Fix table naming**: Use explicit `db_table` in model options to avoid app-label prefix complications
2. **Fix state progression**: Properly pass old_state → new_state pairs to `database_forwards`
3. **Use proper operation imports**: Import operations explicitly to avoid namespace issues
4. **Simplify constraint inspection**: Use simpler approaches that work reliably with SQLite
5. **Follow the existing test patterns**: Look at how the existing test file handles similar operations

Looking at the existing test file, I can see patterns like:
- Using `self.apply_operations()` method that properly handles state transitions
- Using simple table names without complex prefixing
- Testing the actual database alteration effects rather than just state changes
- Using proper operation classes from `django.db.migrations.operations`

The core issue is that when both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, trying to remove just the `index_together` causes Django's `_delete_composed_index()` method to find multiple constraints and throw a `ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints`.

**Key fixes applied:**

1. **Fixed table naming**: Used explicit `db_table` options to avoid app-label prefixing that causes SQL quoting issues
2. **Fixed state management**: Properly clone and progress states in `apply_operations`, passing correct old_state → new_state pairs to `database_forwards`
3. **Explicit imports**: Import operation classes directly from `django.db.migrations.operations`
4. **Simplified constraint inspection**: Use direct SQLite PRAGMA commands instead of Django's introspection API
5. **Better error handling**: Catch `ValueError` specifically to identify the bug, and provide fallback for other errors
6. **Multiple test scenarios**: Test both directions (removing index vs unique) and show the constraint counting issue

This script should now properly reproduce the issue where `AlterIndexTogether` with an empty list triggers the `ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints` in Django's `_delete_composed_index()` method when both unique_together and index_together exist on the same fields.
