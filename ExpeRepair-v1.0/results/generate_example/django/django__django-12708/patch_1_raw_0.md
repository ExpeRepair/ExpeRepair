 ### Phase 1: FIX ANALYSIS

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   The issue occurs when trying to delete an `index_together` constraint on fields that also have a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields. The migration crashes with a `ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints` because the `_delete_composed_index` method finds both the unique constraint and the index constraint, but expects to find exactly one constraint.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   The problem occurs in the `_delete_composed_index` method at line 410-415 in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. When `alter_index_together` calls `_delete_composed_index` with `{'index': True}` constraint kwargs, the `_constraint_names` method returns both the unique constraint and the index constraint for the same fields, causing the length check to fail.

3. **Best Practices**:
   - The fix should be minimal and targeted to the specific problem
   - We should preserve existing functionality for normal cases
   - The solution should handle the case where both unique and index constraints exist on the same fields
   - We should ensure that only the appropriate constraint type is deleted

4. **Fix Strategy**:
   The issue is that `_constraint_names` is finding both unique and index constraints when we only want to delete the index constraint. We need to modify the `_delete_composed_index` method to be more specific about which type of constraint to delete. When deleting an index constraint, we should exclude unique constraints from the search, and vice versa.

### Phase 2: FIX IMPLEMENTATION

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `_delete_composed_index` method. When it's called from `alter_index_together`, it should only look for index constraints, not unique constraints. The constraint_kwargs parameter tells us what type of constraint we're looking for, so we can use that to filter more precisely.
