 Looking at this issue and the analysis provided, I need to create a refined patch that addresses the inconsistent file permissions problem while minimizing backward compatibility concerns.

## Reasoning Step by Step:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The core issue is that uploaded files get inconsistent permissions depending on whether they use MemoryUploadedFile (small files) or TemporaryUploadedFile (large files). The temporary file approach can result in restrictive 0o600 permissions.

2. **Candidate Patch Issues**: The original patch changes the global default from `None` to `0o644`, which is a backward-incompatible change that affects all Django installations.

3. **Better Approach**: Following the analysis suggestions, I should:
   - Keep the global setting as `None` to preserve backward compatibility
   - Modify the `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode` property to default to `0o644` on POSIX systems when no explicit permission is set
   - This ensures consistent behavior without breaking existing installations that rely on the current behavior

4. **Platform Consideration**: The analysis suggests limiting chmod calls to POSIX systems (avoiding Windows) since file permissions work differently there.

5. **Implementation**: I need to modify the `file_permissions_mode` property in `FileSystemStorage` to return `0o644` when the setting is `None` and we're on a POSIX system.

## Refined Patch:

The refined approach addresses the inconsistency by providing a sensible default at the storage level rather than changing the global setting, preserving backward compatibility while fixing the core issue.

# modification 1
```
<file>django/core/files/storage.py</file>
<original>    @cached_property
    def file_permissions_mode(self):
        return self._value_or_setting(self._file_permissions_mode, settings.FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS)</original>
<patched>    @cached_property
    def file_permissions_mode(self):
        mode = self._value_or_setting(self._file_permissions_mode, settings.FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS)
        # Default to 0o644 on POSIX systems when no explicit permission is set
        # This ensures consistent permissions for both small and large file uploads
        if mode is None and os.name != 'nt':
            return 0o644
        return mode</patched>
```

This refined patch:

1. **Preserves Backward Compatibility**: Keeps `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in global settings, so existing projects that rely on the current behavior won't be affected.

2. **Fixes the Inconsistency**: Provides a consistent default of `0o644` for file uploads on POSIX systems, ensuring both small and large files get the same permissions.

3. **Platform Aware**: Only applies the default on non-Windows systems (`os.name != 'nt'`), avoiding potential issues with Windows file permission handling.

4. **Minimal Impact**: The change is localized to the `FileSystemStorage` class and only affects behavior when no explicit permission is configured.

5. **Maintains User Control**: Users can still override this behavior by explicitly setting `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` in their settings, and the new default only applies when they haven't made a conscious choice.

This approach resolves the reported issue while being much more conservative about breaking existing functionality.
