 ### Phase 1: FIX ANALYSIS

1. **Problem Statement**: 
The issue is that Django's file upload behavior is inconsistent regarding file permissions. When files are uploaded via `TemporaryUploadedFile` (used for larger files), the resulting file permissions are 0o600 (restrictive) because Django uses `os.rename()` which preserves the temporary file's restrictive permissions set by Python's `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()`. However, when files are uploaded via `MemoryUploadedFile` (used for smaller files), the resulting permissions are more permissive (0o664) because Django creates the file directly. This inconsistency occurs when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not explicitly set.

2. **Test Script Analysis**:
The test script clearly demonstrates the issue:
- Test 2 shows that `NamedTemporaryFile` creates files with 0o600 permissions
- Test 3 shows that when using a temporary file path (simulating `TemporaryUploadedFile`), the final file gets 0o664 permissions (which is unexpected based on the issue description, but this might be system-dependent)
- Test 4 shows that when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS=0o644` is set, the permissions are correctly applied
- Test 5 shows that `SimpleUploadedFile` (in-memory) gets 0o664 permissions

The key insight is that the behavior is inconsistent and depends on the upload method used.

3. **Code Analysis**:
Looking at the provided code locations:
- Location #1 shows `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `global_settings.py`
- Location #3 shows the `file_permissions_mode` property that returns the setting value
- Location #4 shows the `_save` method where file permissions are only applied when `self.file_permissions_mode is not None` (line 283-284)

The problem occurs because when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None` (default), no explicit permission setting happens after file creation, leading to inconsistent behavior.

4. **Best Practices**:
- Provide consistent, predictable behavior regardless of upload method
- Use secure but reasonable default permissions (0o644 is common for web uploads)
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow the principle of least surprise

5. **Fix Strategy**:
The solution is to change the default value of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` from `None` to `0o644` in `django/conf/global_settings.py`. This ensures that:
- All uploaded files get consistent permissions regardless of upload method
- The permissions are secure but reasonable (owner read/write, group/others read)
- The behavior becomes predictable and documented
